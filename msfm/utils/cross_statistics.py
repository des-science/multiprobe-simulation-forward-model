    """Returns a list of indices corresponding to the auto and cross spectra of the selected probes and tomographic
    bins. Note that this assumes that the channels are assumed to be ordered as lensing first, followed by clustering.

    Args:
        n_z_lensing (int, optional): Number of tomographic bins for lensing. Defaults to 4, like for metacal.
        n_z_clustering (int, optional): Number of tomographic bins for clustering. Defaults to 4, like for reduced
            maglim.
        with_lensing (bool, optional): Whether to include include the weak lensing bins. Defaults to True.
        with_clustering (bool, optional): Whether to include include the galaxy clustering bins. Defaults to True.
        with_cross_z (bool, optional): Whether to include the tomographic cross bins. Defaults to True.
        with_cross_probe (bool, optional): Whether to include the cross probe bins. Defaults to True.

    Returns:
        list: List of indices corresponding to the auto and cross spectra of the selected probes and tomographic bins,
            that can be used for numpy fancy indexing. The length of this list is n_z_bins * (n_z_bins + 1) / 2, where
            n_z_bins = n_z_lensing + n_z_clustering.
